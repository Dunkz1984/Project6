Create a blog page that speaks through Flask


The hardest roadmap.sh problem so far. I, again, had difficult time with learning everything AROUND the solution to this particular problem. At its current stage, it is still really quite a shaky program (there is no code for the "Sign in" tab for example) but it has been interesting to see how flask actually handles these requests quite quickly!

I am learning about programming again and don't consider myself well versed in any part of it at the moment, but even when I was younger and actually made a website for my family's band, I was only able to use HTML - CSS and Javascript (not to mention PHP) were things that I routinely tried to avoid. This meant that I was learning a lot of this for the very first time. The bar at the top does look nicer and I do appreciate how difficult the UI is as a result of this.

This did actually give me a feeling that this is a crossroads. Do you stop here and look towards UI programming or do you stick with the backend development? I thought it would be wise to stick with the backend development, since AI can just outperform my design choices on bascically every level (I believe that every  human alive could design better than me).

So, I have taken the time to actually update my knowledge of CSS and HTML. The previous challenge was trying to guide me towards AJAX, but it is too overwhelming to learn about so much so quickly. I am at the stage of getting used to Flask, but at the same time I need to keep updated with so many other aspects of Python that I am just keeping everything on a superficial level at the moment.
